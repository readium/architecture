# Parsing Accessibility Metadata

The goal of this document is to provide directions that each implementation of Readium can follow when parsing schema.org Accessibility Metadata in EPUB publications. Its focus is the mapping of EPUB 2/3 to the internal Readium Publication model; serialization of the JSON Readium Web Publication Manifest is out of scope in this guidance document.

When parsing a publication in the streamer we always use the most complex form for each metadata to harmonize our output.

## AccessMode

`accessMode` is a key whose value is an array of strings.

It is expected in a conformant EPUB publication ([EPUB Accessibility 1.0](https://www.w3.org/Submission/epub-a11y/#sec-disc-package) and [EPUB Accessibility 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/#sec-disc-package)).

At the time of writing, known values are:

- `auditory`
- `tactile`
- `textual`
- `visual`
- `chartOnVisual`
- `chemOnVisual`
- `colorDependent`
- `diagramOnVisual`
- `mathOnVisual`
- `musicOnVisual`
- `textOnVisual`

### EPUB 2.x

The array is created from the `meta` elements whose `name` attribute has the value `schema:accessMode`. The value of their `content` attribute is pushed to the array.

### EPUB 3.X

The array is created from the `meta` elements whose `property` attribute has the value `schema:accessMode`. Their value (i.e. child textual content) is pushed to the array.

## AccessModeSufficient

`accessModeSufficient` is a key whose value is an array of arrays of strings.

The known values are the same as `accessMode`.

### EPUB 2.x

The array is created from the `meta` elements whose `name` attribute has the value `schema:accessModeSufficient`. 

When the value of their `content` attribute is a single `accessMode`, make an array from the token and insert it into the `accessModeSufficient` array.

When it is a multiple:

- split the value based on comma (`,`) separator;
- trim (left + right) each resulting string token, but leave original whitespaces inside the token – some EPUBs might be using a space separator instead of comma;
- remove duplicate tokens (if any);
- make an array from the remaining ordered tokens;
- insert this array into the `accessModeSufficient` array.

### EPUB 3.X

The array is created from the `meta` elements whose `property` attribute has the value `schema:accessModeSufficient`. 

When their value is a single `accessMode`, make an array from the token and insert it into the `accessModeSufficient` array.

When it is a multiple:

- split the value based on comma (`,`) separator;
- trim (left + right) each resulting string token, but leave original whitespaces inside the token – some EPUBs might be using a space separator instead of comma;
- remove duplicate tokens (if any);
- make an array from the remaining ordered tokens;
- insert this array into the `accessModeSufficient` array.

## AccessibilitySummary

`accessibilitySummary` is a key whose value is a map of localized strings (JSON-LD language maps).

It is expected in a conformant EPUB publication ([EPUB Accessibility 1.0](https://www.w3.org/Submission/epub-a11y/#sec-disc-package) and [EPUB Accessibility 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/#sec-disc-package)).

### EPUB 2.x

The map is created from the `meta` elements whose `name` attribute has the value `schema:accessibilitySummary`. The key of the localized string is the value of the `xml:lang` attribute, and its value the value of the `content` attribute.

In case there is no `xml:lang` attribute to be found, use the `und` (undefined) language value.

### EPUB 3.X

The map is created from the `meta` elements whose `property` attribute has the value `schema:accessibilitySummary`. The key of the localized string is the value of the `xml:lang` attribute, and its value the child textual content.

In case there is no `xml:lang` attribute to be found, use the `und` (undefined) language value.

## CertifiedBy

`certifiedBy` is a key whose value is an array of strings.

### EPUB 2.x

The array is created from the `meta` elements whose `name` attribute has the value `a11y:certifiedBy`. The value of their `content` attribute is pushed to the array.

### EPUB 3.X

The array is created from the `meta` elements whose `property` attribute has the value `a11y:certifiedBy`. Their value (i.e. child textual content) is pushed to the array.

## CertifierCredential

`certifierCredential` is a key whose value is an array of strings.

### EPUB 2.x

The array is created from the `meta` elements whose `name` attribute has the value `a11y:certifierCredential`. The value of their `content` attribute is pushed to the array.

### EPUB 3.X

The array is created from: 

- the `meta` elements whose `property` attribute has the value `a11y:certifierCredential`. Their value (i.e. child textual content) is pushed to the array;
- the `link` elements whose `property` attribute has the value `a11y:certifierCredential`. The value of their `href` attribute is pushed to the array – the value is expected to be a URL.

## CertifierReport

`certifierReport` is a key whose value is an array of strings.

### EPUB 2.x

The array is created from the `meta` elements whose `name` attribute has the value `a11y:certifierReport`. The value of their `content` attribute is pushed to the array.

### EPUB 3.X

## ConformsTo

`conformsTo` is a key whose value is an array of strings.

These strings must be valid URLs. 

Although this URL can be arbitrary, it is likely one of the following:

- http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-a 
- http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-aa
- http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-aaa

The array is created from the `meta` elements whose `name` attribute has the value `dcterms:conformsTo`. The value of their `content` attribute is pushed to the array.

### EPUB 3.X

The array is created from the `link` elements whose `property` attribute has the value `dcterms:conformsTo`. The value of their `href` attribute is pushed to the array.

## AccessibilityFeature

`accessibilityFeature` is a key whose value is an array of strings.

Note the enumerated values are actually open-ended, due to the possible `displayTransformability` suffixes which map to CSS rules.
